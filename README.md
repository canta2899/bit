# bit

## Disclaimer

This is a simplified version control system that offers basic functionalities to initialize a project, save a snapshot, list the snapshots, and checkout one of them. It was entirely developed using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) as a proof of concept for a talk I presented. All the code was generated by AI and made available on GitHub to explore Cursor's capabilities more thoroughly.


## Features

- Initialize a repository with `bit init`
- Save snapshots of your project with `bit save`
- List all previous saves with `bit list`
- Restore to a previous save with `bit checkout`
- Restore to latest save with `bit now`
- Ignore files using `.bitignore` patterns (similar to `.gitignore`)

## Build

```
go build -o bit ./cmd/bit
```

## Usage

### Initialize a repository

```
bit init
```

This creates a `.bit` folder in the current directory to store all version control information.

### Save a snapshot

```
bit save "Initial commit"
```

Creates a snapshot of the current state with the given name.

### List all saves

```
bit list
```

Shows all previous saves with their hash and name.

### Restore to a previous save

```
bit checkout abc123def456
```

Restores files to the state of the given save hash.

## Using .bitignore

Create a `.bitignore` file in your repository to specify patterns for files that should be ignored:

```
# Comments start with #
*.log
node_modules/
build/
```

## Implementation Details

- All version control data is stored in the `.bit` directory
- Saves are identified by a unique hash
- File contents are stored in the `.bit/objects` directory
- Metadata is stored in `.bit/metadata.json`
